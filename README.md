# Ass-4

This project implements Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Dijkstra's algorithm using a custom Vertex-based weighted graph structure in Java.

Structure
- Vertex.java — Represents a vertex with adjacent vertices and weights.
- WeightedGraph.java — Graph implementation using a map of vertices.
- Search.java — Interface for search algorithms.
- BreadthFirstSearch.java — BFS implementation using `Vertex`.
- DijkstraSearch.java — Dijkstra’s algorithm implementation.
- Main.java — Example usage with sample graph.
